## Assignment 3
### MART 341-WebDesign

I really liked this week's module and learning about the internet, and how crucial it is to understand the internet, as it is a necessity to getting a website you designed to be online. I particularly enjoyed learning about Visual Studio Code, which is a text editor which simplifies the process of coding for a website. **Although I think Visual Studio Code is difficult and takes some additional time**, it has been fascinating following along with the external course website tutorials and seeing it actually work on my laptop. 

I don't think I really have any questions about what we learned this week, so I wanted to share some of my favorite things I learned while following along with the module for Assignment 3:

1. How to insert links, and how simple it can be. This was super easy to me, so I want to share one of my favorite sites to shop. [One of my Favorite Sites!](https://turquoisetradersdirect.com/)
2. Inline Code-- and how large amounts of code should be inserted into code blocks.
3. I also found it interesting to learn how to insert an image to your directory, such as this picture of me: ![ME](https://github.com/sophianohle/MART341-WebDesign/blob/main/Assignment3/assignment-03/images/-01-2022-23-35-41.jpg)

*Brittany-- I apologize again for all the trouble with Assignment 3! Thank you again for your help & troubleshooting.*
