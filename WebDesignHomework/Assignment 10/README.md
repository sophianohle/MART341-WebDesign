For this week's assignment, **I want to focus on my index.html page from Assignment 8.** This website is my professional resume site. 


- **Create a page with an external CSS style sheet:**

    -  I linked my external CSS style sheet to my index.html page for my professional resume site. 


- **Use at least 1 class selector:**

    - I used the class selector for my expertise and about section on my index.html. I wanted these sections to be styled the same, even though the content is different-- so utilizing the class selector allowed me to do so.


- **Use at least 1 ID selector:**
    - I used an ID selector for my photo gallery, doing id="photo-gallery". I did this so that the styling of my photo gallery that I did, such as the borders, alignment, and size only apply to those within my photo gallery. 


- **Three Additional Techniques Used:**
    - *Different Background Colors:* I changed the section background colors from the same light pink that my navigation bar is, to black with white text to create more contrast. 
    - *Text Alignment:* I decided to center the text in my sections and remove the bulleted list. I think I like this spacing and alignment better!
    - *Borders:* I decided to add borders on the photos of my photo gallery. I think it created good contrast and made it easier to differentiate the photos.
