### Step 1: Preheat your oven & wash/dry ALL produce.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees, and wash and dry produce. 

### Step 2: Prepare your carrots
Trim, peel, and cut your carrots, diagonally into 1/2" thick pieces. Then, toss your carrots onto your baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast them on the top rack until tender & brown. Roughly 20-25 minutes.

### Step 3: Prepare your scallions & lentils
Trim & thinly slice your scallions, keeping both the greens and whites in seperate piles. Drain and rinse your lentils as well. 

### Step 4: Combine in a pot.
Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add your scallion whites, stirring until fragrant. ~30 seconds. Then, add your lentils, stock concentrate, red pepper crema, chili powder, and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir until combined. 

Bring to a simmer, then reduce your heat to low, cooking & stirring occasionally until it is heated through. ~ 6-8 minutes. 

### Step 5: Prepare & cook your pork. 
Pat your pork dry with paper towels, and season entirely with salt and pepper.

Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add your 10oz of pork and cook until browned and cooked through. ~3-4 minutes PER side. Turn off heat when complete, transfer pork to a plate and wipe out pan. 

### Step 6: Add in your crème fraîche and butter.
Stir in your crème fraîche and 1 tablespoon butter into your pot with lentils. Taste & season with salt and pepper if desired. 

### Step 7: Create your sauce.

Thinly slice your pork crosswise.

## Additional Tips:
- Make sure your pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees.
- If your pork begins to brown too quickly while cooking, turn down your heat to a lower setting.
- If your lentils seem too soupy while cooking, increase the heat and cook until thickened to your liking.
