For this week's assignment, **I want to focus on the styling of my index.html page from Assignment 8 with CSS fonts, decorating, and alignment** This website is my professional resume site. 


**Required Elements:**
- An external CSS style sheet: Done!
- Hover Effects-: I did this on my navigation bar. Now a decorative line appears when you hover over it!
- A self-hosted font: Miniver Font
- A font from a library: Google Fonts embedded code
- Three Additional Elements of your Choice:
    - I added a pseudo-element for the decorative line below each of my navigation links 
    - Adjusted the letter spacing in the "Expertise" section to enhance readability.
    - I increased the margin in between my sections to create more white balance and better spacing.
