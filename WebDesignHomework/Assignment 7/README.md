I think I am most proud of my work experiences page. I feel that the spacing is good, and that it is easy to follow along with. I decided to make my contact form on another html page, so I am proud of myself for being able to connect all of them and make it easy for users to go back to my home page. I struggled a little with creating that contact form for people to thereotically reach out to me, but it was so rewarding once I figured it out and looked through the resources. I think I would like to add some more to that page, like maybe my LinkedIn link? I also was struggling with my background and text colors, and I finally think I figured it out and realized what I was doing wrong!
