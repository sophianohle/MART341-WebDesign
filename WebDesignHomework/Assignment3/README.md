## Assignment 3-- Topic Materials
### Questions About What I Learned This Week: 
  For this week's assignments and the readings **I found that it definetly got harder than the previous two weeks**. GitHub is a totally new concept to me, so I was a little overwhlemed with reading all the readings and steps on the external course site, and all the new features I learned. I think a lot of it is starting to make sense, but I definitely needed to re-read it again and absorb the information.

*Questions I Have:*

1. How do I do a bulleted list w/o making it bold?
2. Is there a way to adjust the sizing of images in a ReadMe?
