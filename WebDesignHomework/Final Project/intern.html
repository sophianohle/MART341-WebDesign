            <p>During my internship at Dillard's, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in various aspects of the retail industry, including inventory management, data analysis, and cross-functional collaboration. This experience allowed me to develop valuable skills that have shaped my professional growth, and knowledge in the behind the scenes of Dillard, and how they operate in a complex world of retail.</p>

                <h3>Analyzing Inventory Systems</h3>
                <p>One of the things I learned in my intership, was Dillard's inventory system, AIMI. This system plays a crucial role in inventory management across different departments such as Juniors, Accessories, and Home. By analyzing this system, I was able to identify trends and recommend improvements for optimizing stock availability and turnover.</p>

                <h3>Data-Driven Decision Making</h3>
                <p>Using DDSF, I conducted in-depth analysis of daily sales performance, comparing year-over-year data to identify patterns and areas for improvement. This experience reinforced the importance of leveraging data to drive business decisions and optimize operations. Learning this feature in my internship, is something I still use every time I am at work.</p>

                <h3>Capstone Presentation</h3>
                <p>For my capstone presentation as part of my internship, I integrated insights from my data analysis to recommend an increased focus on high-performing brands at our store, like BDG by Urban Outfitters. This presentation demonstrated my ability to use data to support business strategies and contribute to decision-making processes.</p>
