            <p>In 2022, I started as a Dillard's Campus Collective Ambassador for the University of Montana. I could have never imagined becoming a campus ambassador then, would have led to the work experiences, relationships, and skills I have gained today.</p>

                <h3>CAMPUS COLLECTIVE AMBASSADOR</h3>

                <h3>SUMMER INTERN</h3>
                <p>This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Dillard's, where I gained hands-on experience in various aspects of retail operations, including inventory management, data analysis, and strategic project coordination. One of the most exciting parts of my internship was being able to travel to Billings, where I participated in a special project to evaluate sales trends and inventory systems. I worked closely with teams across multiple departments, analyzing performance data and contributing to key decision-making processes. Through this experience, I developed a deeper understanding of retail operations and the importance of data-driven decisions in a dynamic business environment.</p>
