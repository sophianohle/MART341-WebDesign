**Required Techniques for Assignment 8:**
- Div (at least 2): I tried to be consistent and use the div tag across all my pages on my site, such as div class experience, contact, and references. 

- Span (at least 2): I used span on my work experiences page to highlight the dates I worked at different places. I chose to make these a darker pink against my background of the page. I used it several times on that page.

- Audio (at least 1): I used the audio technique on my contact page.

- Video (at least 1): I used two videos, both on my Education & Volunteer Experiences page. I wanted to include a little more about the organizations I volunteer for, so I found videos on youtube & embedded them into my web page so viewers could easily view and watch.

- Iframe (at least 1): I used iframe for maps in the footer of the University of Montana. I did not want to put my home location, so I did the university since it is relevant to me and gives people an idea of where I am geographically located.

- Class (at least 2): I used the class technique a lot, but especially on the homepage for the different sections, including the photo gallery, about me section, and expertise.  

- Escape Character (at least 1): An example of using an escape character in this assignment was for my footer, where I did: &copy; 2024 Sophie Nohle Professional Resume. All Rights Reserved.
