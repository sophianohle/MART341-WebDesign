**At Least 4 Pages** – I used 6 pages. My index page, my contact page, my work experiences/education page, my linkedin subpage, my email subpage, and my work experiences page. 
**Responsive Design** – My website layout adjusts as you make the window smaller to it fits the space. I also utlize grid layouts and media queries. 
**Media Queries** – I used the mobile-friendly, first approach. From there, i set up a mobile view and a tablet view so that the width is adjusted for different sizes. I did the media queries on my style sheet. 
**Navigation Menu** – I used my navigation bar, with sub-pages under my contact page. This appears when you hover over it. 
**Dropdown Menu**– I used the dropdown menu under my contact page with an email and linkedin page.
