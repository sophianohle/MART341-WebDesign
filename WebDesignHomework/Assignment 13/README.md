**Index HTML page for my professional portfolio**

Sizing: I edited the width of my sections, such as the about me and expertise to make it max width so there was better centering for the design element.

Border : I added a border to my about me and expertise sections to create more of a consistent look that matches the border around my images in my photo gallery. 

Overflow: I updated my style CSS with overflow properties to avoid my content going outside of it's containers. I did this for all of my content styling using the overflow:hidden code.

Padding: I adjusted my padding to get rid of unwanted space, but specifically focused on the padding in my navigation bar to have less space vertically, making it look cleaner. 

Margin: I modified the margin for my about me and expertise section to create more white space between the two to create more white balance. 


Position : I edited the position of my navigation bar to "fixed" so that it is always at the top of the screen when someone is scrolling on my page. I also also modified the positioning of the footer to be relative, so that I can fine tune.
