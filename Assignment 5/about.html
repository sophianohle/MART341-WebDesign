<H1> Why I Chose These Website Ideas</H1>


<h2> Website Idea 1: Photography</h2>
<p> I tried setting up a website for my photography in the past, but I think learning what I have been the last month would make it an easier process, and turn out 100x better and more organized. I don't do photography as much anymore as I found it frusterating to create a platform to share my work on, so creating a website may be a way to open myself back up to photography again.</p>

<h2> Website Idea 2: Digital Resume</h2>
<p>As society is becoming more and more digitally based, creating a website with pages such as an about me where I could share images, experience, contact info, etc-- where I could share a link with people would be awesome, and easily accessible to most all people. <br> I also like the aspect of it being interactive and organized versus just a printed document or PDF emailed.</p>

<h2> Website Idea 3: Concert Experiences Blog</h2>
<p> For those who know me, everyone knows I love a good country concert. As a matter of a fact, I was just at Colter Wall last night, and I am going again tonight. I have had some pretty unreal first row experiences at artists such as Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Brad Paisley, Chris Stapleton, Zach Bryan, and so many more.I have never really wrote about some of the experiences I have had, and I think creating a digital scrapbook and journal of them would be something cool to go look back on. </p>
